# Welcome to my GitHub!

I am a student of Computer Science at the University of Antwerp.
This account contains repositories that correspond to my courses at the University. They are currently unavailable to the public but will shortly be made public after some reformatting has been done.
I will use these to showcase the projects I made during for the courses but also my own personal projects.

### The following repositories of this year's courses that will be published at the end of the year:

| Course | Repository |
| :--- | :--- |
| Programming | For Python "OefeningenPython", for C++ "OefeningenCPP" and for the exam "Shaken". |
| Data Structures | "GAS-ADT", data structures and their implementation in Python. |
| Computer Systems and Architecture | "CSA", MIPS assembly exercise and a Logisim project + HTML reports. |
| Computer Graphics | "CG", computer graphics exercises and their rendering. |
| Project SE | "SE", Software engineering project. |
| Automata | "TA", exercises on Automata. |
