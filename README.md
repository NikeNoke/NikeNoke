# Welcome to my GitHub!

I am a student of Computer Science at the University of Antwerp.
This account contains repositories that correspond to my courses at the University. They are currently unavailable to the public but will shortly be made public after some reformatting has been done.
I will use these to showcase the projects I made during for the courses but also my own personal projects.

### The following repositories of this year's courses that will be published at the end of the year:

| Course | Repository |
| :--- | :--- |
| Programming | For Python "OefeningenPython", for C++ "OefeningenCPP" and for the exam "Shaken". |
| Data Structures | "GAS-ADT", data structures and their implementation in Python. |
| Computer Systems and Architecture | "CSA", MIPS assembly exercise and a Logisim project + HTML reports. |
| Computer Graphics | "CG", computer graphics exercises and their rendering. |
| Project SE | "SE", Software engineering project. |
| Automata | "TA", exercises on Automata. |
| Calculus | "Calculus", exercises on Calculus formated with LaTex (generally to learn LaTeX). |


### Personal projects which I'm planning but are yet to be started.

| Project | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Discord CatholicBot | A discord bot that will be like the [BibleBot](https://gitlab.com/kerygmadigital/biblebot) but instead it will have resources in the available languages (but first starting with English) ranging from but not limited to: <ul><li> Encyclicals,</li><li> Ecumenical Councils and their documents,</li><li> Church Fathers, </li><li> and other important documents </li></ul> |
| Tetris | A functional Tetris game made in C++ using OOP. The point of this project will be to test my own abilities and to make a fun copy of a classic game with my own little twist. |
| Price checking Web Scraper | An application that will automatically check prices of certain products you're interested in and send you emails when the price fall under a certain threshold you give. Also allows for an option to automatically purchase the items when they fall below that threshold... project will make usage of [Selenium API](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/#) |
| A project page | A webpage with a nice overview of all my projects with interactive pictures and more made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. |
| Financial responsibilty app | An application that uses "data magic" to analyze your financial state, and handles ways to limit wasted resources and gives cheaper alternatives or ways to be more financially responsible. More details will follow... |

And of course there will come many more projects not only on my own but also in team which will be published to this account.
