# Welcome to my GitHub!

I am a student of Computer Science at the University of Antwerp.
This account contains repositories that correspond to my courses at the University. They are currently unavailable to the public.
I will use these to showcase the projects I made during the course of my studies but also my own personal projects.

### The following repositories of this year's courses (2022-2023) that will be published someday:

| Course | Repository |
| :--- | :--- |
| Programming | For Python "OefeningenPython", for C++ "OefeningenCPP" and for the exam "Shaken". |
| Data Structures | "GAS-ADT", data structures and their implementation in Python. |
| Computer Systems and Architecture | "CSA", MIPS assembly exercise and a Logisim project + HTML reports. |
| Computer Graphics | "CG", computer graphics exercises and their rendering. |
| Project SE | "SE", Software engineering project. |
| Automata | "TA", exercises on Automata. |
| Calculus | "Calculus", exercises on Calculus formated with LaTex (generally to learn LaTeX). |


## Update!
Currently on hiatus due to burnout and illness for an indefinite period.
